# Fetch Challenges

Two engineering challenges in one.

## Two? Why?

I had missed the emails sent by Fetch's recruiter. @kjkondratuk reached out to see what was up, and forwarded to me one of the engineering challenges: the pyramid word challenge. Shortly after I had started working on it in a REPL, the recruiter reached out, again. I found the buried email with the original challenge, and decided that I'd complete both of them.

You can find the repl where I had started my work, before moving it to a github repo, here: https://repl.it/@LiamConrad/PyramidWord.
